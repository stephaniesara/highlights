The Lazy River is fun and you can even take your drink with you!  This is not the case in many other hotel pools.  We chatted with some guests but I was not in the mood to socialize but rather really relax.  The impression I got though was if you were interested in socializing," you could.

This property is huge so if you have an aversion to walking do not stay at the MGM.  The guestroom elevators are far from the main entrance.  The pool is quite a distance from the guestroom elevators as well.  However, if you do not mind walking, love Lazy Rivers, and enjoy many options for shopping and dining then stay at the MGM.\",2,0,1,1514

We always stayed at the Golden Nugget but for the past two years, we have been staying on the strip.  This year we started at the Monte Carlo and ended up at the MGM before it was time to go back home.
The most important part of our trip is not gambling but relaxation and with that comes the expectation of laying out by a wonderful pool and having lunch, reading, sleeping, swimming oh and drinking (not too much but a bit) frozen Pink Lemonade with Absolute CitroÃ«n Vodka, YUM! 
We loved our stay at the MGM.  It is such a large property with so much to do and so close to other popular properties like New York New York.  The guestroom was very modern and the bed was exceptionally comfortable.  The swimming pool area was FABULOUS!  Although it is quite a trek from the guestroom to the pool, it is worth every step.  I love the layout, theirs an adult area, the music is just the right decimal, and they have a friendly and accessible wait staff.  The food was reasonably priced and acceptable.  I say reasonably because remember we are in Vegas, lying by the pool and someone is waiting on us and the only work we have to do is chew and swallow our food and drink.

We booked online through their website. I would definitely suggest doing it. Sure, you *may* get a better rate somewhere else, but chances are, you won't be treated as well. It's common knowledge that hotel's treat customers who book directly with them better because it shows that you chose them not based off their lowest price, but because you wanted to stay at a specific hotel. 

The Signature is one of the highest rated hotels in Vegas for a reason. All the rooms are suites. It's a non-gambling, non-smoking hotel. There are 3 towers, and each Tower has it's own Pool area. The Towers are all connected to each other with indoor walk-ways and attached to the MGM Grand, with moving walk-ways. Tower 1 is the closest to MGM Grand, and Tower 3 is the furthest. I stayed in Tower 2 and was very happy with it, the walk was very reasonable.

I've heard nothing but awesome things about this place had plans to try it out. And then I saw a $20 Groupon for $40 worth of food. You better believe that I got on that faster than Speedy Gonzalez! Be aware though, If you are using a Groupon, you can't use it on happy hour items! Full priced menu items only. But the menu items are decently priced and you'll leave with a full and happy belly for $40 worth. 

Service is outstanding here. Our server always checked up on us to see if we needed anything else. There was a gentleman that always checked up on us too, I think he is the owner. He told the sushi chef to fix my boyfriend and me Tensai Hamachi Shooters on the house! The hamachi is mixed with a spicy ponzu sauce and some truffle oil. Win!

It was cold outside so we ordered some hot tea. You have a choice from the green, apple and mint. My boyfriend had the hot apple tea. Aroma of this one is fantastic and it tastes just like granny smith apples. 

And now, the food. Oh my my my my! 

- Spicy Tuna Crackers: Ahi tuna in a special sauce on wasabi rice crackers. The crackers were quite interesting. A zing from the wasabi is a nice touch to the tuna.
- Yellowtail jalapeno: 5 pieces of thick yellowtail sashimi in a yuzu cilantro sauce. Garnished with a jalapeno and a sliver of cucumber. The sauce didn't overpower the fish. The jalapenos were really spicy when we went. But nonetheless, this was yummy. 
- 808 Tapas Nasu Fries: Panko crusted eggplant with wasabi lime dipping sauce. I can have 10 orders of these to myself! Thick eggplant slices, they don't skimp out. Piping hot and the cooling sauce is the perfect combination. My new guilty pleasure for sure.

I hopped on yelp and tried the hot and new option, this was the first place that popped up. Granted it's not \"chicken and waffles\", but it was close enough for my craving. I knew as soon as I pulled up that I made the right decision. The aroma of fried chicken and fresh donuts oozing out of the place makes your mouth water before you even open your car doors. I got a half dozen premium donuts and a 12 wing order.

Pros: 
-Everything was fresh, the donuts had just been made, I saw them bring out the chicken from the walk in and start frying it up. This isn't stuff that sits under a heating lamp.
-Offers both indoor and outdoor seating
-They offer flavored seasoning sauces for the fried chicken.
-Awesome service and friendly employees

Cons:
-I wanted to try two different sauces with my 12 wing order and the charged me for two 6 wing orders rather than one 12 wing order because it was an inconvenience for them.
-The price is a little ridiculous. For 6 premium donuts and 12 wings I paid $26.

We have friends visit from Chandler, and they wanted to go to the Buffalo Chip, so we agreed. 

First the place looks great. I was never there before the fire, but I imagine it looks better now. But the tables are just folding tables and the chairs folding chairs. Not the most comfortable. They need to invest in more permanent digs. 

Now on to the food. Between all in the group we ordered many dishes. I ordered the Iceburg Wedge with Blue Cheese and a Fish Taco. The Wedge was $6 and the Fish Taco was $4. Honestly neither was all that good. The taco was quite small and just had a few pieces of fried fish cut into small pieces. Â The salad had some blue cheese, Â but it seemed like ranch dressing, and store bought certainly. Definitely not worth $6 in my opinion. 

My wife had the pulled pork sandwich for $9. Was a normal sized store-bought hamburger bun (unheated) with pulled pork, along with a SMALL amount of baked beans. The baked beans were cold, and the container the beans came in was one of these small containers they usually use for sauce. Tiny.

This was the WORST resturaunt experience in my ENTIRE life. The reasons for this are:

1) The $3 lb of wings seems really appealing. Too bad it is EXTREMELY misleading. They give you 5 TINY wings and force you to order an (overpriced) drink with it. If you want to order another lb, you have to order ANOTHER drink. Your $3 lb turns into $18.

*Important to note: NO FREE REFILLS when a soft drink is $4. Ridiculous, right? 

2) HORRIBLE HORRIBLE SERVICE!!!!!!!!!!!! I had to go up FIVE seperate times to the bar.
The first time was to ask where our waitress was. The second was for napkins. Third was for the menu since their wing promotion was VERY disappointing. Fourth was for water. Fifth was to get our bill. 

*Note- you would think the waitress would come to your table since you asked for a menu which means you were contemplating ordering more food. Stupid.

*She also did not ask how anything was. 

3) They charge you an extra DOLLAR for dipping sauce.... when it should come with one. There is also no carrots or celery.

I ordered it rare, it came medium-rare.  Yes there's a difference and yes to me it makes a difference.

It wasn't as plentiful as I might have hoped, though, given the price of Â£11 (when is haddock and chips ever the second priciest thing on the menu?) - there were probably about twelve wedgey-chips although there were two strips of haddock fillet, which were tender and falling apart beautifully, and the batter was wonderful.

I mean, it's not like there are 431 steakhouses in Vegas or anything. I am going to do my best to cover all the bases here, but I gotta be honest. Charlie Palmer Steak delivered one of the greatest and most synchronized dining experiences I have ever had and this is how the story goes. 

The location:

Located inside the four seasons hotel, the restaurant itself is a bit darker than I enjoy, but it's a huge location that is very inviting. There is a very nice bar located near the front that seemed to be a bit dead. More than likely that has more to do with the fact that if your reservation is for 7PM you get seated at 7PM. That is how it went on Wednesday night, so I am not sure how it works out on the weekends when there are more folks in town.

The menu: 

Very extensive menu that hits on a number of different price points. They give you an opportunity to go small, medium or big and big is B-I-G!!! They have what's called the \"cut of the week\" which is a pri fix menu option that includes 3 courses and two sides for $48. That's a great deal for the amount of food they serve. 

The Food:

I knew before I sat down that I was going to pay a premium for dinner and that wasn't an issue for me. I was just hoping that the food would be off the charts good and I would get what I paid for and that's exactly how it went down. 

We ordered oysters which were from the pacific northwest (I forget the name but I'm not hypercritical about the specific types of oysters when I dine at a high end restaurant) and they were amazing. Perfectly chilled, perfectly shucked and almost as fresh as the oysters I get here in San Francisco. My date doesn't even dig oysters and she loved them.

My date for the evening, Lizzy, ordered their \"cut of the week\" option and it was as follows:

First course Bib lettuce salad

The lettuce was too large to eat and probably could have been chopped to fit on the fork. The blue cheese was really strong for my taste but the bacon lardons were perfectly crisp and delicious. Overall the salad was good, but nothing special.

Second course 16 oz. NY Steak

The cut was a very large portion and it was cooked almost perfectly. It had a bit too much gristle for my taste but it Lizzy killed it so she clearly didn't have a problem with it. Seasoned well, tender and the sauce that accompanied it was flavorful and a great addition. 

Dessert Meyer Lemon Creme Brulee 

Custard is not my thing but I tried it. It was a bit too tart for my taste buds and I wouldn't order it. 

2 sides Baby Broccoli and Garlic Mashed Potatoes

Baby broccoli was cooked just they way I like it. Crisp, bright green and still crunchy but cooked all the way through. Garlic mashed were good. It tasted like there was a bit of truffle oil goin on but I was focused on the red meat more than the starch. I mean, I didn't come to Vegas for the mashed potatoes. Feel me??

My Entree  Surf and Turf

Wonderfully seasoned and perfectly cooked filet mignon. Melt in your mouth good and absolutely amazing quality on this cut. Each bite tasted better than the previous bite. half tail of Maine lobster, cooked perfectly, with drawn butter and it was stuffed with a truly delicious mix of lobster, lobster stalk, fresh bread crumbs and a few special ingredients the waiter left out. Lobster meat was pulled away from the shell, which is a nice touch b/c who really wants to sit there with a bib on shucking lobster from the shell? I sure don't. 

"
10 out of 10. The waiter was friendly, he knew the menu up and down, answered all of our questions (and we had plenty) and was on top of his game. A step further. Our waiter had a party of 8 and a party of 6 seated as we were eating dinner. Instead of ditching us all together, another waiter came over to make sure we were doing ok and was also on top of his game. The communication between waiters, servers and the rest of the staff was absolutely perfect and I had never seen anything like it. Something as simple as pouring water in a glass was handled with such care. The waiter would hold a napkin over the glass each time she/he poured making sure we didn't get splashed. At times, they were a bit too fast for their own good. They took away my fork, knife and small plate after they cleared the oysters, but I'm not complaining because I was flat out impressed by the attention to detail. Each and every person working the room had a smile on their face, they were chatty but not too chatty, they took pics of people who wanted them to and it was truly a top notch dining experience and I can't wait to head back for more.\",3,0,1,38771

Chicken strips can be easy to dry out, if not done right, but man...whether it was fried or baked these strips were always moist and seasoned just right. My boyfriend loved the fried because he loves panko breaded chicken :)  The mac n cheese....ohhh gooey cheesy goodness. Actually baked in the oven.

This is a usual Friday night date spot for me and my boo. Usually has a wait but we get lucky every time to find a seat at the bar to order a pre dinner cocktail. The lemon drops are tasty, the BF gets gin and tonics normally. He wishes they had a little more selection of gin..but no big deal. 

We like to go for the date night special where we can sample an app, salads, and a main meal for about $30 bucks a piece. We are not strict on how much we spend on meals so it just depends on what the main entrees there are offering at that time.

My typical eating style is big eyes, smaller stomach. I order way too much food but luckily, my man usually eats any left overs the next day. 

I am a big fan of the the artichoke dip with the salsa as an appetizer and I usually go straight for the ribs. They are damn good! I have also had a steak that is marinated in balsamic vinegar. The steak looked funky when they brought it out, I didn't say anything and they said they were already making me another steak to take home. OK! Steak and eggs for breakfast.

Ahh the King Eddy...when you walk in you just want to straighten your posture, pull out the manners your momma taught you and act like you know what you are doing.  

The lobby of the hotel is beautiful - at the front they have a seating area with some lovely plush chairs/sofas with the really high backs so you feel like royalty sitting in them.  There are also giant black chess pieces that anchor the seating area.  There is a restaurant right at the entrance and one towards the back (i believe it's called the Victorian room) and this is where high tea is served.

As this was my first time, I wasn't sure where high tea would be so I asked the concierge.  Instead of just pointing me in a vague general direction, he came around the desk and walked me almost to my destination. Now that's class and service!

The high tea menu is 3 main prix fixed menu choices - one with savoury sandwiches, one with desserts and in the summer they have a combo deal (sammies and desserts).  The combo is $45 while the other 2 are $35 so for $10 more it just makes sense to go with this option.  The $45 option also comes with a small strawberry/lemonade drink as well.  There is also a vegetarian menu option as well. 

I'm not sure if the sammies/desserts change ever once in awhile but everything was delicious - there was one sandwich - buttermilk fried chicken on some slaw on a sesame seed bun....explosions of deliciousness in my mouth.  This was my fave sandwich.

The desserts were the typical scones, jams, chocolate mousse cake, a berry parfait (oh my!).  As we went for a friend's birthday they even brought a piece of chocolate cake over with a candle!

You choose your tea from a variety of loose leaf teas.  I had the Kind Eddy specialty blend - it's made specifically for the hotel and it was divine.  A robust flavour of the tea similar to that I am used to (chai).

The service is impeccable here - from being knowledgeable about the teas to making sure we had enough hot water to showing you exactly where the washrooms are (instead of just pointing) makes me feel like a high flying player.

My girlfriend and I purchased bikes after being persuaded by the bike lead that if the bikes aren't a right fit, then bring them back. Not once were we informed of their unfair return policy. 

I love my bike, but my girlfriend did not like hers after riding on it for less than a mile. It just didn't feel right to her. So I packed it in the car with receipt and paperwork in hand, walked into the store and inquired about returning the bike to a cashier who immediately retrieved the store manager. I don't remember the guy's name, but he's middle aged and surly. A total jerk. He explained that it was policy not to refund bikes because they have been used and the store would lose money. 
\"The tires are worn, anyway.\" 
\"No they're not. Just a little dust. Those tires have less than a mile on them\", I said. 
\"She could have rode the bike upstairs to see if was a right fit. Customers do that all the time.\"
\"How was I to know that. The bike lead informed us if the bikes aren't a right fit, bring them back.\"
\"Sorry. That's our policy.\" Walks away. What an ass!

Not once were we informed about the no refund policy. Otherwise, we would have not made the purchase. This is such unfair and sketchy business practice. What if you purchase a bike as a gift for someone, and it is not a good fit. Oh well, it's now used and we would take a hit if we offered a refund. So, the company is more worried about losing on a $350 bike than losing a customer who could potentially spend hundreds, if not thousands of dollars per year. 

Some good did come out of this. My girlfriend, who has more balls than I do, called in an explained without being angry, but firm, why they should refund the purchase. I'm not going to go in detail, but she is very persuasive. And it was refunded. 

As I did some research, and it seems like DICKS is notorious for poor customer service and a strict return policy. It's funny. I believe they are trained to say the same lines when it come to returns with bikes. Almost verbatim from what I read of other customer complaints.

Firstly, people should recognize the restaurant for what it is: Korean fushion food. Thus, there's a wide variety of sushi, my personal favorite: hwe dup bap (like sashimi salad) and a smaller selection of hot (but still great--scallops anyone?) entrees that I usually have no interest in because I love sushi that much. 

If you need a quick sushi fix, dollar sushi Sundays (1 roll = $1) will definitely satisfy your cravings. There are 10 rolls that are offered at that price and they are definitely more of an American style sushi roll (read: little to no raw fish). At first I was really disappointed by this, but I honestly felt like the other rolls were good enough (Big Roll! Coconut Roll!) that I didn't mind at all and eat about $15-$20 worth of sushi anyway. Yes, I am a sushi whore. 

If you really want good sushi (with more raw fish or more interesting combinations), Kofusion is still the place to go. Their sushi menu is surprisingly extensive with your typical simple salmon rolls to rainbow-type rolls and more. It's about $1-$2 dollars more expensive than the other places in town but I've never felt like my rolls weren't worth the cost. 

Finally, Kristina is my favorite waitress. Maybe she remembered me for my order (hwe dup bap--seriously, try it if you love raw fish, it is divine) or maybe because I loved her so much I tipped well, but after just a few weeks of going weekly, a lot of the waiters remembered me and greeted me warmly. As a sushi lover, it doesn't really get any better than this. 

I'm not going to lie, Kofusion hits your wallet pretty hard but in the world of sushi, I don't find them especially more expensive than other sushi places that offer the same variety and quality of rolls. One recommendation I have is to try and get a roll (i.e. Big Roll--that's the one I had) wrapped in soy/rice paper. For those that don't like sushi because of the seaweed, this is a great alternative. For those that still love sushi, try it anyway--it's a great substitution that's worth it to get on its own once in awhile.

So you look for a hotel just off the strip and find the Westin. Seems nice ... has all of the amenities one wants in a Vegas hotel ... and best of all it's only a block off the strip.

But you're a discerning shopper and do a little more research and you find that the Westin isn't  all that much cheaper than some big name options actually on the Strip. And while pleasant, if you're going to spend the money in Vegas, don't you want the pizzazz that goes with it?

The Westin suffers from being the neither fish nor fowl of the Las Vegas hotels. My company sent me here for a week long convention and it was perfectly pleasant and well run. The single (real) restaurant that the Westin boasts (Savona Bistro) has excellent food at above average prices (note: not off-strip prices). The casino itself is minuscule by Vegas standards but has a homey feel when a table gets roaring.

Would I stay here if I were paying my way through Vegas? Sadly no. I've been to Vegas many times, both on the cheap and spending money like a high roller. If I want to do Vegas the cheap way I go to the Palace Station or similar hotel and if I want to blow my kid's college fund (f the little beggars!) I stay at the Luxor or MGM Grand.

Reservations seem to be a must. Our first attempt to come here was without a reservation and they were booked for the entire evening. This time I made a reservation on Open Table for a 6:00 dinner. The restaurant was pretty full this time as well.

The restaurant is bright and cheery. It's much more open than the last Italian restaurant that was in this spot. The restaurant is beautifully decorating and very inviting. Next to the hostess stand there are couches for lounge seating, a large bar, tables, booths, and two outdoor patios with seating. In the back there is a private room that can seat a large group. 

We were brought the bread board to start. The parmesan crisp and olive bread were my favorite. The lemon honey butter served with the bread was delicious. The presentation of the bread was nice. I ordered a Red Sangria which had a nice flavor and wasn't overly sweet. It was a measly portion for $12 so I'd pass on this next time. 

Before our meal we shared a Caesar Salad and Meatballs. The Caesar Salad dressing tasted homemade. The meatballs were good, but could have used some more seasoning and the marinara sauce was well flavored. I liked the fresh mozzarella with the meatballs. 

For dinner I ordered Chicken Parmesan and my husband ordered Short Rib Cavatelli. The Chicken Parmesan was delicious and tender enough to cut with a fork. The sauce was delicious and the cheese on top was the perfect amount. My husband's Short Rib Cavatelli was delicious as well. The sauce on it was great and the short rib was in large, tender pieces in the pasta. I loved the whipped lemon ricotta in the dish which sent it over the top. My husband and I ordered one pasta dish and one meat dish on purpose so that we could share with each other since the chicken doesn't come with any sides. Sides can be ordered a la carte, but given the size of entrees that would be an excessive amount of food.

Dessert is a must here. When I first looked at the dessert menu I was not that intrigued by any one item, but I'm not one to pass on dessert. The Dessert Sampler seemed like a good item for my husband and I to share so we went with that option. Everything on the sampler was amazing and it was a very good deal for the amount of dessert. The Tiramisu was one of best I've ever had with a lovely flavor. The Strawberry Limoncello Pannacotta was the best item with plenty of lemon zest, strawberries, and a to do for strawberry compote. The donuts were light and perfectly textured with a nice lemon curd. As if that wasn't enough there were two delicious chocolate dipped shortbread cookies. Everything on the plate was a great dessert.

The thing that most worried me about trying this restaurant was the service. We've had terrible experiences with service at Hank's and we were worried that it was a GVR curse. Not at all. Our waiter was attentive, water glasses were continuously filled, and all of our food came out in a well timed manner. Our waiter did get more tables as were wrapping up so it took a little time to get our check, but he apologized without us saying anything. So, based on our experience I don't have any concerns about the service.

There is only one thing that detracted from the experience for me and it will be a deal breaker if it wasn't a one-off. Nobody else has mentioned it so hopefully it was a one-off. When we first arrived the music was at a reasonable volume. About 30 minutes later they turned it up so loud that my husband and I were screaming to talk to each other. When the live musician arrived it didn't get any better. This restaurant just doesn't seem like the proper venue for music that loud.
"
We came here in a large group for dinner and the server was very helpful in helping us order our dishes.  For an appetizer, we had the Mussels Mantra. The flavor was good, but it was overcooked....a lil tough and chewy. We also tried the Padpi Chat. I was definitely not a fan of this item. For the entrees, we decided on the sea bass, the Chicken Tikka Masala, Lamb Mantra and the Dewane Handi. Out of everything, the sea bass was my favorite, flavored just right. The lamb was dry and the dewane handi was bland to me. I think my favorite part of the meal was the Nan. I wasn't too impressed with the meal and after we got the check it made me less impressed. Like I said before, we had a large group (15 people) and it came out to be 41 dollars a person....or 82 dollars a couple in our case. I'm definitely not stingy when it comes to good food, but for the price and what we got I'm not sure I will be returning unless its for the lunch specials.\",5,0,2,62525

I almost screamed with joy when walking into the bakery. Everything was perfect. From the pastries, the chocolates, the baked goods, and even the gelato looked pretty. http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=jZqViN77-gIVUxT62EFE9w&userid=QkQLnujuiBDP1mNChJYJww
Although I would have liked to try a crepe I had already bought an Earls Sandwich and was just looking for a dessert to bring on the plane..... 

There are many pastry options whether you are a chocolate person, a fruit person, a custard person, they have it all. They even had extravagant macaroons. http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=VOFgHdstzzjhi3S1gq38dQ&userid=QkQLnujuiBDP1mNChJYJww  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=IQmkc5uyqdw6THBDerkyvw&userid=QkQLnujuiBDP1mNChJYJwwThe prices on the pastries is where unfortunately Jean Philippe loses a star in my book. Close to $7 for a pastry is ridiculous. I don't care how good it is - and yes it was good but not $7 good. I have eaten perfect pastries similar to this in Japan and even those aren't $7.  

I was eyeing the Napolean but it looked like it had a little too much custard cream so I went with the fruit tart. It was beautifully deorated with raspberries, blueberries, blackberries, strawberries, slices of apples, kiwis, and pineapple and some mandarin oranges. I know that Jean Philippe aims for quality over quantity and I completely respect that but the tart part seemed a little thin. This was my only complaint as the fruit was perfectly ripened and the custard cream wasn't overly sweet. http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=QkQLnujuiBDP1mNChJYJww

The sizzling seafood dish (#1 house special) should be called swimming seafood stink dish because it is sloshing around in a soupy, dishwater grey sauce that is ick-o!  We picked out the shrimp & scallops to take home & left the rest of the mess (mushrooms that were bruised and probably too old to be eaten, carrots, zucchini," lobster bits & disgusting chunks of non-distinguishable fish). 
"
Service is not any better.  Waiter was impossible to understand, sizzling rice soup was sloshed all over the table cloth, wine glass had leftover lips on the rim, water was splashed all over when glasses were filled," plates were clanked and knocked around very loudly & main dishes were served about 10 minutes apart.  
"
Pad Thai is FULL of red & green bell peppers and purple onions so for my pepper & onion haters out there," do not order this dish!!!  Chicken also tasted like it had been swished around a wok full of seafood....that or it was a day past its prime (I'll find out tomorrow!).

Here's how it works: when you walk in (the place isn't big), you'll be given a disposable spoon so you can walk around the store and sample their many flavours until you figure out which flavour you'd like. There's so much variety that the process can take a few minutes. After you've decided," you let them know at the counter and they'll put a bag together for you.

We ended up going with a Small bag of the 'Confetti' popcorn, which had a variety of flavours thrown together, since we were indecisive. If you aren't feeling adventurous, they also have regular \"normal\" flavours like buttered popcorn and salted popcorn. Note that while some of the sampling jars can get stale, the popcorn in the bags are very fresh. Also note that despite the store being pretty small," products are organized well.
"
Overall, not only are these snacks to satiate your popcorn desires, these can also be great for gifts, stocking stuffers, and souvenirs," and I'm so glad I found this place for my gourmet (or not) popcorn fix. 
"
For a small bag of 'Confetti' popcorn, we paid $6.00. We'll definitely be back when we're in the area again.\",12,7,13,81753

Ich bin zusammen mit einem Arbeitskollegen gegen 21:30 Uhr in dem Resataurant - Pattenser Feldweg 7, Hemmingen, Arnum - erschienen, wir waren zu diesem Zeitpunkt die einzigen GÃ¤ste. Wir bestellten Lammfilet in CASSIS RahmsoÃe (das Gericht besteht aus drei Lammfilets in viel SoÃe, ohne weitere Beilagen, nur Brot dazu) zuerst bekamen wir einen Salat als Vorspeise serviert. Nach einer Weile kam dann der Ober und brachte uns das Hauptgericht mit den Worten: \"Wir haben nur einmal mit CASSIS und einmal mit METAXA\" und stellte es uns einfach auf den Tisch.Â 
"
Da wir extra nur gekommen waren wegen Lammfilet mit CASSIS, waren wir enttÃ¤uscht, dass angeblich nur ein Gericht mit Cassis vorhanden sei. Jedoch waren beide Gerichte ohne Cassis, sondern mit Metaxa und dazu auch noch mit Paprikapulver Ã¼berstreut. Es schmeckte so schlecht," dass wir nur die Lammfilets gegessen haben und die SoÃe nicht weiter anrÃ¼hrten.

The menu is fairly diverse which is as to be expected from your normal beer bar, and typically these kind of places pride themselves on burgers so I opted in.  I ordered a black and blue burger with a side of fries.  There was nothing about it that was all that great.  I'm a blue cheese fanatic, and theirs is really good, but the burger itself wasn't anything special and the fries were a little too greasy for my tastes.  I'm sure if I was lit up like a candle on booze, and ordered this around midnight, it would be the greatest thing I've ever eaten," but it wasn't the case.
"
Again, I could see this being a pretty cool place to hang out at, especially on their outdoor patio during the summer/fall, but otherwise," it just felt like another bar.
"
I don't drink beer, so my review is solely on the food," however their beer selection was very impressive and I could see how this could be a popular place especially during happy hours.  
"
I've driven past this place a billion times visiting my friend and never went in.  Today was the day.  With it being Labor Day Sunday, the place was empty which was good, because I could imagine if it was busy," parking would be at a serious premium.  It looked like there were only about 30 spaces shared with a used car lot.

So much so that when I went away abroad for school a couple of years back, I stowed away packets of Kernels in my suitcases. So when I stumbled upon this place at Kensington Market, I fell in love. A total gem for popcorn lovers; there are so many options that you actually get overwhelmed. Kernels is peanuts compared to these guys.

We visited on a Friday evening and were immediately blown away with the variety presented to us. You name the flavour, no matter how crazy, they'll have it - Green Apple, Strawberry Ice Cream, Tex Mex, Maple, Cookies & Cream - you name it, they'll have the popcorn.
