there would be a negative, it would be a misleading menu.  I ordered the Filet Mignon Sliders, that (according to the menu) come with cheese (I forgot what kind,) and caramelized onions.  What I got was ground Filet (at least I hope it was,) a crumbly white cheese, some kind of orange sauce on it," and the onions were some fried thinly sliced onions on top of the sliders all over the plate... sort of like having onion rings on a burger... not really caramelized onions.
"
Other than that, we had the Tuna Tartare, which was excellent.  Also, the Lamb sausage," which was good as well.

This review is for their billing department. 10 months after my original USG and procedures, I received a bill from collection agency, and the annoying  phone calls started.

After some manager promised to fix the problem finally, another bill from collection agency arrived. Again, after another 25 minutes on hold, back and forth, I was told the manager went home, and I have to call back.

I opted for the Wagyu Kobe beef burger, which was amazing. It was super juicy and rich and just everything that I expected it to be. Yes, it was a $25 hamburger but it was worth it. And, even though my stomach was stretched to capacity, you're damn right I ate every bit of it. My boyfriend got the Oregon Trail which was a buffalo burger and he was raving about that as well. We split an order of the Parmesan Garlic fries," and those were super delicious too.

Oh, and whoever said that it feels like you're in a giant mushroom house, they are absolutely right! You'll understand if you go.\",0,0,0,8051
It was definitely kind of pricey for what you actually get, I think we ended up paying about $75 after tax and tip but the spiked shakes were kind of on the pricey side. So if you don't get one of those, I would say $50 for two people could easily be achieved. I know there are practically a million restaurant options in Vegas," but this one was pretty good and who doesn't love a good burger?

The shaved ice comes in four different sizes which are child, small, medium, large, and bowl. The sizes are really an understatement though, because every size is hugeeeee. I think it should be renamed medium, large, the small island," and the really big island. I think the child or small is great for individual and medium and up is big enough to share.

I honestly don't know the difference between good shaved ice and GREAT shaved ice," but I know that the shaved ice from SnOw OnO delicately melts in your mouth very quickly like.. cotton candy.

When the weather warms up I can definitely see SnOw OnO being crazy busy because of their super value and its ONOlicious (ono means delicious).  SnOw OnO is usually found at farmer's market, such as Fresh 52, Bruce Trent park, and the Garden's Park. http://twitter.com/#!/SnOwONOShaveIce for more information :)\",0,0,0,6900

There are 36 flavors and additional toppings such as condensed milk, sour spray, and azuki beans. They also offer sampling the flavors before you buy it, similar to when you buy gelato :). You can get up to 3 flavors for each order, which is great that they don't limit the flavors based on size. I had the melona and tiger's blood with condensed milk," and holy wow I don't know the origins of those flavors but mhmmm they're good.

I Love Burgers looked decent and expresses a sentiment that I feel, so we opted to go there. It was fairly busy when we were there, but we were seated right away so it wasn't terrible.

Service was excellent all around. I can't remember our waitress' name, but she was great and gave many good recommendations when we told her it was our first time at their restaurant. I saw that they had spiked shakes and I knew we had to get one. We went with the Twisted Caramel Corn and it was spectacular. Our waitress said they were a pretty good size, so we decided to split it and they even put it in separate glasses for us, which was nice.
