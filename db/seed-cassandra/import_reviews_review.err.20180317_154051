We always stayed at the Golden Nugget but for the past two years, we have been staying on the strip.  This year we started at the Monte Carlo and ended up at the MGM before it was time to go back home.
The most important part of our trip is not gambling but relaxation and with that comes the expectation of laying out by a wonderful pool and having lunch, reading, sleeping, swimming oh and drinking (not too much but a bit) frozen Pink Lemonade with Absolute CitroÃ«n Vodka, YUM! 
We loved our stay at the MGM.  It is such a large property with so much to do and so close to other popular properties like New York New York.  The guestroom was very modern and the bed was exceptionally comfortable.  The swimming pool area was FABULOUS!  Although it is quite a trek from the guestroom to the pool, it is worth every step.  I love the layout, theirs an adult area, the music is just the right decimal, and they have a friendly and accessible wait staff.  The food was reasonably priced and acceptable.  I say reasonably because remember we are in Vegas, lying by the pool and someone is waiting on us and the only work we have to do is chew and swallow our food and drink.
"
The Lazy River is fun and you can even take your drink with you!  This is not the case in many other hotel pools.  We chatted with some guests but I was not in the mood to socialize but rather really relax.  The impression I got though was if you were interested in socializing," you could.
"
This property is huge so if you have an aversion to walking do not stay at the MGM.  The guestroom elevators are far from the main entrance.  The pool is quite a distance from the guestroom elevators as well.  However, if you do not mind walking, love Lazy Rivers, and enjoy many options for shopping and dining then stay at the MGM.\",2,0,1,1514
"We received two free buffet tickets one for my husband and I each and we did try the main buffet for breakfast.  I am not a fan of buffets but I was quite surprised at the quality of the food as well as the broad selection offered.  I would definitely eat at the main buffet if we were ever to stay at the MGM again.

We tried the following month and found the same exact problems. Food was ordered long after arriving through no fault of our on and then we had an endless wait with no food. Left again as this was unacceptable to wait over 35 minutes for food on another weeknight. Again no one really seemed to care about the lack of service given. Seems it is the way they operate. Won't be back to this location again. The location in Kannapolis needs to teach these people how it is done.

We booked online through their website. I would definitely suggest doing it. Sure, you *may* get a better rate somewhere else, but chances are, you won't be treated as well. It's common knowledge that hotel's treat customers who book directly with them better because it shows that you chose them not based off their lowest price, but because you wanted to stay at a specific hotel. 

The Signature is one of the highest rated hotels in Vegas for a reason. All the rooms are suites. It's a non-gambling, non-smoking hotel. There are 3 towers, and each Tower has it's own Pool area. The Towers are all connected to each other with indoor walk-ways and attached to the MGM Grand, with moving walk-ways. Tower 1 is the closest to MGM Grand, and Tower 3 is the furthest. I stayed in Tower 2 and was very happy with it, the walk was very reasonable.

The Signature also has check-in available at McCarren airport(although hours are subject to change, they were not open when I arrived a little after 5 pm on a Saturday). This is the first of it's kind of any hotel in the US. Although, I was bummed that they had just closed a few minutes before I arrived(they were even helping customers, but refused to open up for me). While I did have quick and easy check-in when I arrived at the hotel," I really wanted to take advantage of this convenience. This would honestly be the only con I had the entire stay.

You can catch a cab outside the Signature as well, or they sometimes have Limos available for a reasonable rate. They held our luggage after check-out," and let us use the pool after check-out as well.

It's location is great if you plan on seeing a show at the MGM Garden Arena," and there is also easy access to the Monorail.

When staying at the Signature, in addition to the pools at each tower, you also get access to the huge pool complex at the MGM, which includes 5 pools, hot tubs, and a lazy river. We used both during our stay, and it was nice to have the different options," on a busy day the pool complex at MGM might be overwhelming.

We stayed on the top floor(38th floor) and had a wonderful view. Our room was spacious, and comfortable. There is a kitchenette included, as well as a 2 person Jacuzzi tub in the bathroom. All the staff were kind and knowledgeable. Check-in was easy," and Housekeeping was fantastic.

This hotel may not be on par with places like The Ventian, Bellagio or Ceasar's Palace but it is a great value. The price was on par with places like Mandalay Bay, Treasure Island, New York, and was much," much better quality.

I've heard nothing but awesome things about this place had plans to try it out. And then I saw a $20 Groupon for $40 worth of food. You better believe that I got on that faster than Speedy Gonzalez! Be aware though, If you are using a Groupon, you can't use it on happy hour items! Full priced menu items only. But the menu items are decently priced and you'll leave with a full and happy belly for $40 worth. 

Service is outstanding here. Our server always checked up on us to see if we needed anything else. There was a gentleman that always checked up on us too, I think he is the owner. He told the sushi chef to fix my boyfriend and me Tensai Hamachi Shooters on the house! The hamachi is mixed with a spicy ponzu sauce and some truffle oil. Win!

It was cold outside so we ordered some hot tea. You have a choice from the green, apple and mint. My boyfriend had the hot apple tea. Aroma of this one is fantastic and it tastes just like granny smith apples. 

And now, the food. Oh my my my my! 

- Spicy Tuna Crackers: Ahi tuna in a special sauce on wasabi rice crackers. The crackers were quite interesting. A zing from the wasabi is a nice touch to the tuna.
- Yellowtail jalapeno: 5 pieces of thick yellowtail sashimi in a yuzu cilantro sauce. Garnished with a jalapeno and a sliver of cucumber. The sauce didn't overpower the fish. The jalapenos were really spicy when we went. But nonetheless, this was yummy. 
- 808 Tapas Nasu Fries: Panko crusted eggplant with wasabi lime dipping sauce. I can have 10 orders of these to myself! Thick eggplant slices, they don't skimp out. Piping hot and the cooling sauce is the perfect combination. My new guilty pleasure for sure.

I hopped on yelp and tried the hot and new option, this was the first place that popped up. Granted it's not \"chicken and waffles\", but it was close enough for my craving. I knew as soon as I pulled up that I made the right decision. The aroma of fried chicken and fresh donuts oozing out of the place makes your mouth water before you even open your car doors. I got a half dozen premium donuts and a 12 wing order.

Pros: 
-Everything was fresh, the donuts had just been made, I saw them bring out the chicken from the walk in and start frying it up. This isn't stuff that sits under a heating lamp.
-Offers both indoor and outdoor seating
-They offer flavored seasoning sauces for the fried chicken.
-Awesome service and friendly employees

Cons:
-I wanted to try two different sauces with my 12 wing order and the charged me for two 6 wing orders rather than one 12 wing order because it was an inconvenience for them.
-The price is a little ridiculous. For 6 premium donuts and 12 wings I paid $26. 
-The service is slower than I like. Not bad. Just a little slow.
